## WARNING: This is EXPERIMENTAL do not use in Production

Tiny Moqui is a SUPER simple Moqui project that does some of the basic part of [Moqui](https://github.com/moqui/moqui-framework) in a very tiny and simple way.

This is an exercise in understanding Moqui, learning how to program in Java / Groovy well, and playing around with various different architectures in Moqui without the hassles of dealing with all the production code.
